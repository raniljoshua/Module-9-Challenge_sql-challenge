EmployeeSQL problem
----------------------------
Used PostgreSQL to perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis; imported departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, and titles.csv; and performed the following analysis:

* Data Modeling:
  * Created ERD of tables using https://dbdiagram.io/d
* Data Engineering:
  * Created Table Schema for each of the six CSV files (specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other contraints)
  * Imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table
* Data Analysis (performed the following queries):
  * List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
  * List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
  * List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
  * List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  * List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
  * List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
  * List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  * List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
